# hello-world
Starting in GitHub community. This is my respository number 1 ;)
I'm just following the steps on the guide for GitHub. My name's Marcelo. I'm a Digital Marketing Analyst and Planner, currently studying Project Management and trying to get into the world of coding. I don't think I'd become a developer but I'm enthusiastic about working in the IT Field through my areas which are: Communication, Marketing & Digital Media.
